<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
nf-core/miniranger is a lightweight bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) utilizing mainly simpleaf. simpleaf is a rust framework that simplifies the processing of single cell data using tools from the alevin-fry ecosystem. The pipeline takes a samplesheet, FASTQ files, and reference genome FASTA and annotation (gtf) files as input. It performs quality control (QC) and pseudoalignment, and produces a cell x gene expression matrix and QC report as output.
