This project aims to replicate the analysis from "Replicating "Decoding aging in the heart via single cell dual omics of non-cardiomyocytes" using Python. The original study applied single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) analysis in R, utilizing packages such as Seurat and Signac. This repository provides a step-by-step Python implementation using the scverse ecosystem, which consists of Scanpy, muon, and other related libraries.
